# WRANDTEL Brand Guidelines

## Brand Story
WRANDTEL combines strength and connection, represented by our distinctive ampersand logo. The "&" symbolizes partnerships, collaboration, and the seamless integration of services we provide. The square frame represents stability, reliability, and the structured approach we bring to every project.

## Logo
Our primary logo features a stylized ampersand enclosed within a square frame, creating a balanced and memorable visual identity that embodies our commitment to connecting ideas, people, and solutions.

### Logo Variations
Our brand identity system includes four authorized logo variations:
- **Primary Logo**: Black ampersand on white background with red frame
- **Inverse Logo**: Black ampersand on red background with white frame
- **Gray Background**: Red ampersand on gray background with white frame
- **Dark Mode**: Red ampersand on black background with gray frame

### Logo Clear Space
Always maintain sufficient clear space around the logo. The minimum clear space should be equal to the height of the square frame divided by 4.
